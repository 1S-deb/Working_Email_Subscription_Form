How It Works: Form â†’ Google Sheet via Apps Script
HTML Form + JavaScript

A simple email subscription form built using HTML and CSS.

JavaScript captures the form submission and sends the email address to a deployed Google Apps Script endpoint.

Google Apps Script (deployed as Web App)

Handles incoming POST requests via doPost(e).

Extracts data (e.parameter.email) and records it into a Google Sheet.

The script is deployed with permissions set to "Anyone, even anonymous" so it accepts external requests.

Real-World Outcome

When users submit their email, it automatically gets added to your Google Sheet.

Ideal for launches, newsletters, beta lists, etc.
